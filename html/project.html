        <h2>Summarize the problem</h2>
        <p>A tool to align your purchasing power with your moral beliefs. Aligns ensures your money in no way supports organizations or companies that contribute to causes that are antithetical to your beliefs. Align will notify you of products to avoid before adding to your shopping cart when online shopping. 
            An Align user can browse our selection of curated boycotts put together by organizers of social movements, activists or political organizations and create their own boycotts to share with other users.
            <br/>
            The Align application works as a web overlay which is used to provide contextual information on browsed products while online shopping. 
            This first iteration of the project will let a user create a profile, view boycotts, opt in to boycotts and create their own to share

            For our future phases, we were planning to add more features that could be more impactful for our users by adding an upvote and downvoting option for certain boycotts.

            Here are the current results of our team's effort.

        <p>
            These are our diagrams on what we were planning for the boycott app. We would create an app for those who want to create a movement and protest and for others to notified their protests.
            Our team was considering our platform to be accessible on multiple devices like laptop and mobile to allow as much people as possible to be able to access our app.
        </p>
        <p>
            What it felt like to experience what we did was interesting. The reason was that in my view, this is one of the longest projects that I did with a team.
            Managing the project with others wasn't too bad because we assigned each other and distributed our work rather well. 
            We would check with each other if we had any questions or ideas about what task we're working on and see if it would be approved or could do some adjustments.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            What I wanted to do for my part is to make the code simple because I had to create a form. A form shouldn't have a large amount of colors and making the user have a troubling time trying to fill details out.
            Another thing is that I'm also contributing to the User Stories that we had. It was specifically the one about creating boycotts that has not been mentioned.

        <p>
            User Stories:
            As a User, I want to view boycotts so that I can be informed when making purchases. <br/>
            As a User, I want to save boycotts so that I can have a way to reference specific products to avoid<br/>
            As a User, I want to create boycotts for an issue or cause that is not already in the Align system<br/>
            As a User, I want to share boycotts so that I raise awareness to others on other platforms about current boycotts<br/>

        <h2>My Contributions</h2>
        
        <p>
            What I have contributed in the project was the boycott creation forms project. I also checked my other member's code if it was well commented and checked if there was slight problems to the interface. If there was no commented code I would give them a reminder that they need to comment their code. 
            Some things that I have contributed outside of doing coding is that I did a good amount on the planning process and readjustments for our project and checked in on my team members. Some examples of my contribution is to clean up our SRS by readjusting our list of steps, readjusting test plan and checked if there was something inconsistent that needed to be changed.
        </p>

        <h2>My experience</h2>
        <p>
            From this experience I learned how to plan out a project and later plan out a project with my team members. 
            
            I thought that this was a step to apart of my long journey to my career so I had mixed feeling of excitement and nervousness. However, I know that this experience will help me with what it would be like to work in a team environment and possibly how projects will be laid out.

            The strengths that I learned from the experience is that I got to strengthen my skills at git and github because I still think that I'm new to github and I got to learn about branches.

            Some humbling moments from this was that I felt like I wasn't contributing as much to the team compared to other people because I saw that some of their code was amazing and that some of the code are things that I have little to no understanding about and feel inexperienced compared to others. 
            This experience is a common phenomenon called Imposter Symdrome and is experienced by many others in the industry.
            How I broke through this is to not be afraid to ask on something you don't know. I would ask my team members about things I had no ideas about. Even though I felt like I didn't contribute as much for a certain week, I knew that I had some large contributions in the other weeks and I shouldn't undervalue myself just because I felt like I didn't do too well for only one week.
            I needed to remember that it's alright to think that I'm inexperienced because I'm still starting out. I know that everybody starts off somewhere and this is where I started off trying to learn about things.

            We're still currently building our project and the next steps that we're on is adjusting the backend of our app. We're still trying to develop our website's appearance to be improved on because we thought that it can be even greater.

        <h2>My advice to others who're pursuing the same path as me</h2>
        <p>
            Pointers that I would give to someone is to never be afraid to ask someone a question. It's ok to not know something because we've all started at one point and not know what we're doing. 
            If you're asking questions, others won't see down upon you and they're likely more than happy to help you. Another tip that I would give is to keep track on what you do by having a journal of some sort. 
            You may think that it would be easy to remember, but it's actually very difficult to try and remember those things later on especially if you don't use them for a period of time.
            Finally my last pointer that I would give to someone is to not feel discouraged by other's skills and abilities. It takes time to learn about things like programming. You will eventually develop the skills on your own and get better each time you practice it.
