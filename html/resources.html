W3Schools is one of the largest web developer site. It's very well known from many users for its text tutorials which includes HTML, CSS, Javascript and much more. <br />
I have used W3Schools before and it shows basic examples for the user to understand what it should look like and what each specific tag does. W3Schools offer a vast amount of programming languages tutorials and explains it in a simple way that users, whether young or old, to understand the concept. 
Some of the tutorials allow you to experiment around with the code. It's very helpful and easy to understand for beginners.<br />

CodeAcademy is a platform that offers free coding classes in many different programming languages.<br />
I have heard of CodeAcademy before, but I haven't really tried it out until now. It introduces you to the basics and allows the user to perform the code. This is good for beginners wanting to know how to code or a refresher for those who have coded before. 
This allows the user to know the fundamentals while also teaching them how to perform them. This website is recommended for people who learns from executing and typing the code. <br />

Khan Academy is a non-profit organization that offers a variety of lessons in videos that helps educate students.<br />
Khan Academy gives video lessons on the basics of programming. However, there's not too much on specific programming languages that they'll teach. Khan Academy is a great website, but it doesn't offer too much programming lessons compared to others. <br />

<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/">GeeksForGeeks</a><br />
GeeksforGeeks is an organization that offers free tutorials and provides code examples that help students and those who are more experienced in programming.<br />
I think that this website can provide specific ideas and requirements for what the user might wanted. 
It can also provide those who are looking for jobs and prepare for interview questions. It has many programming languages that can provide help for people. The main downside that I have for this website is its searchibility for programming languages. In my experience, there's nothing that I need on the main website, but when you click on a same category that you're trying to search for, it'll pop up the specific programming language you're looking for. <br />

<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a><br />
StackOverflow is a Q&A Website for programmers. It allows experienced programmers to ask other programmers around the world.<br />
StackOverflow is a good website for those who are already well experienced into programming. It's good for searching for some specific code that you might need. However, I think that it won't offer as great of benefits for those who are still new to programming. There are times where you found the answer that you're looking for, but it can be unreliable to hope that your question will be on the site especially if it's extremely specific.' This is a Q&A website so it's highly recommended for those who are new to use other websites. <br />

        Google Cloud is a cloud computing sevice that Google owns. You will be able to start a free trial for Google Cloud. The free trial contains $300 in free credits and you have 90 days. <br />
        I am still currently new to Google Cloud but being able to create a virtual machine for free for a while is really good. It allows those who are new a chance to experiment with these features.
        I think the main downside to Google Cloud is that your credits will eventually run out or days remaining. When your free trial runs up, you'll have to start paying out of pocket. If you don't want to do that, then you can always get another account and start another trial but that can be rather tedious.<br />
